# MIT-Algorithms
This repository is all of the lecture notes, problem sets, and programs I have done based on the MIT Introduction to Algorithms course.
Hopefully this page will help you stay organized while you take the free MIT courses online. I am alway free to help with probelm you may have, so feel free to email me at any time with questions about the class. I personally have not been in the class, but I am in the process of taking the online version. I will be periodically updating this github in order to help other students to learn more about algorithms.
